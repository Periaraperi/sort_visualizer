# sort_visualizer

Simple bubble sort visualizer with sdl2

# build on linux
make sure to install sdl2 and cmake according to your distribution.
sdl2 works out of the box on linux.
# to compile this program
- create build directory (mkdir build)
- go inside and run root cmake text file (cd build; cmake ..)
- compile using gcc (make)

# build on windows
on windows you can use mingw or visual c++ compiler and compile from powershell.
You need to download sdl2 development version accordingly and link it to your project.
I have provided 64 bit mingw version and visual c++ version in 'external' directory.
You can change CMakeLists.txt to use either one, or set sdl2 yourself so it will work in IDE.
Don't forget to copy sdl2.dll file in your executable's directory
